To ensure your Logic + Luxury framework is immediately felt, the messaging on each page must speak directly to the specific "pain point" that led the visitor to that domain.

Here are the Hero Section headlines and sub-headlines for your three-domain architecture.

1. lnlgroup.com (The Master Brain)
Focus: High-level strategy and the total integration of both wings.

Main Headline: Growth Architecture: Where Logic Meets Luxury.

Sub-headline: We align your brand’s prestige with your business’s precision. From Raleigh to Moscow, we engineer the digital infrastructure that justifies your premium price point and automates your scale.

Call to Action (CTA): [Apply for a Growth Audit]

2. lnlcreatives.com (The Digital Face)
Focus: Aesthetics, Brand-Mining, and Market Authority.

Main Headline: The Digital Facelift: Architecting Unrivaled Market Prestige.

Sub-headline: Your brand must justify your pricing before you ever speak to a lead. We use proprietary Brand-Mining to extract your hidden authority and build a visual presence that commands respect in luxury markets.

3. lnlautomations.com (The Mechanical Heart)
Focus: Systems, AI, and Reclaiming Time.

Main Headline: The Mechanical Heart: Systems Architected for Scale.

Sub-headline: Scaling shouldn't mean working more hours—it should mean better logic. We install custom AI ecosystems and Lead-to-Client Logic that eliminate labor leakage and reclaim your "Zone of Genius."

Visual Logic for the Hero Sections
lnlgroup.com: Use a video background of high-end architecture or minimalist cityscapes (Raleigh/Moscow).

lnlcreatives.com: Use high-contrast, editorial-style imagery. Think "Vogue" meets "Silicon Valley."

lnlautomations.com: Use a clean, dark-mode interface with subtle animated flow-lines or "Mechanical Heart" schematics to represent n8n/AI logic.

The "LNL" Navigation Bar
Since all three domains lead to the same app (Option 2), your navigation bar should be consistent across all pages to encourage cross-wing exploration:
