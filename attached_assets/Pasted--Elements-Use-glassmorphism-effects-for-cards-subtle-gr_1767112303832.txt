what is my brand style for lnl group

Based on your sources and our conversation history, your brand style is defined as "Architectural Luxury". This aesthetic is designed to position you not as a freelancer, but as a high-end institution that provides both "Identity" (The Face) and "Intelligence" (The Brain).
The overarching philosophy is "Logic + Luxury". To achieve this, your brand uses a shared "DNA" (backgrounds and fonts) with distinct color systems for your two specific wings.
1. The Global Design System (The "Glue")
These elements are consistent across the entire LNL Group ecosystem to ensure it feels like one cohesive family.
• Primary Background: Deep Charcoal (#1A1A1B). This acts as the "soil" for all brands, representing power, depth, and stability.
• Typography:
    ◦ Headlines: Montserrat (Bold/Extra Bold). chosen for its modern, geometric, and expensive look,.
    ◦ Body Text: Roboto (Light/Regular) or Inter. Selected for high legibility, especially for technical descriptions,.
• UI Elements: Glassmorphism. Use semi-transparent cards, subtle gradient borders, and minimalist layouts to maintain a modern feel,.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. The Three-Tiered Visual Hierarchy
A. The Master Brand: The LNL Group
• Role: The Executive Architect / Parent Company.
• Palette: Metallic Silver / Off-White (#E5E4E2) on Deep Charcoal.
• Vibe: Institutional, Authoritative, and Architectural.
• Logo Style: A "Stamp of Quality." A minimalist "Roof" icon placed inside a geometric shape (square or circle) to look like a developer's seal.
• Usage: Business plans, legal contracts, and the main hub footer.
B. Wing 1: LNL Creative (The "Face")
• Role: Aesthetic Authority.
• Palette: Signature Teal (#008080).
• Textures: Organic. Use marble, linen, brick, stone, and soft lighting. This appeals to the aesthetic/emotional side of your clients.
• Logo Style: A variation of the seal in Teal, emphasizing narrative and identity.
• Target: Med Spas and Luxury Real Estate.
• Vibe: Refined, Editorial, and Local.
C. Wing 2: LNL Automations (The "Brain")
• Role: Workflow Intelligence.
• Palette: Electric Cobalt (#2E5BFF),. (Note: Some prompts also reference Cobalt Blue #0047AB, but the "Electric" shade is specified for the high-tech glow effects).
• Textures: Geometric. Use glass, steel, blueprints, circuit lines, and "glow" effects to signify energy and movement,.
• Logo Style: A variation using a "Node" or "Hexagon" icon instead of the roof to signify connectivity and systems.
• Target: Sector-agnostic (Lawyers, HVAC, CPAs).
• Vibe: Precise, Logical, and Scalable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Web Design Strategy
To accommodate both styles without clashing, your website architecture uses a specific layout strategy:
• The Split-Screen Hero: The homepage (index.html) should feature a "Dual-Path" design. The left side uses a soft-focus interior image with a Teal overlay (Creative), while the right side uses a sharp macro tech shot with a Cobalt overlay (Automations).
• The "Ecosystem" Bridge: You bridge these two distinct styles with a unified headline: "Identity & Intelligence for the Modern Enterprise".
• Navigation: Organized like a premium portfolio with dropdowns for "Creative," "Automations," and "The Ecosystem".
Summary Metaphor
Think of LNL Creative as the Interior Designer who makes a house look like a multi-million dollar listing, and LNL Automations as the Engineer who wires the smart-home systems. The LNL Group is the Architecture Firm that houses them both.
sumarize my brand voice between the three companies

Based on your strategy documents and the Master Brand Kit, the brand voice for the LNL ecosystem is built on the philosophy of "Logic + Luxury".
While the parent brand acts as the stabilizer, the two wings have distinct personalities to appeal to different psychological needs (aesthetics vs. efficiency).
Here is the summary of your brand voice across the three entities:
1. The LNL Group (The Parent)
Archetype: The Executive Architect Voice: Institutional, Authoritative, and Architectural. The "Hook": "Identity & Intelligence for the Modern Enterprise."
• Role: The "Group" voice is the stabilizer. It speaks to high-level strategy rather than specific tasks. It bridges the gap between how a business looks and how it runs,.
• Tone: Stable, expensive, and confident. It does not use "fluff" or "hype." It speaks in terms of infrastructure and legacy,.
• Key Phrase: "We provide the Face and the Brain of your business".
2. LNL Creative (Wing A)
Archetype: The Aesthetic Authority Voice: Refined, Editorial, and Sensory. The "Hook": "Visual Authority for the Category-of-One."
• Role: This voice functions as the "Face." It appeals to the emotional and aesthetic side of the client (specifically Med Spas and Luxury Real Estate),.
• Tone: Boutique and narrative-driven. It uses terms like "Brand-Mining," "DNA," and "Curated" to emphasize that the work is bespoke, not templated,.
• Key Concept: "Visual Imposter Syndrome"—the idea that a high-end service shouldn't look amateur online.
3. LNL Automations (Wing B)
Archetype: The Technical Intelligence Voice: Precise, High-IQ, and ROI-Focused. The "Hook": "Intelligence at Scale. Freedom by Design."
• Role: This voice functions as the "Brain." It appeals to the logical and efficiency-driven side of the client (Lawyers, HVAC, Business Owners),.
• Tone: Silicon Valley speed meets Consulting reliability. It speaks in data: "Speed-to-Lead," "Digital Debt," and "Time-Reclaimed." It avoids marketing jargon in favor of mathematical value (e.g., "15 hours saved"),.
• Key Concept: "The Digital Employee"—positioning AI not as a tool, but as a workforce member that never sleeps,.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary Analogy
To visualize how these voices work together:
• LNL Creative is the Interior Designer who ensures the house looks like a multi-million dollar listing.
• LNL Automations is the Engineer who wires the smart-home systems so the lights and locks work automatically.
• The LNL Group is the Architecture Firm that oversees the entire build to ensure the design and the engineering work in perfect harmony.
