## Lainie's Brand Philosophy

> "Custom is the Map; Brand Growth is the Guide"

This means:
- Every client gets a customized approach (the map)
- But the destination is always sustainable brand growth (the guide)
- We don't force-fit solutions; we architect them
- Strategy informs tactics, not the other way around
