# LNL Ecosystem Web Project

## Business Overview
This project is a multi-faceted web presence for **Lainie (LNL)**, focusing on three core pillars:
1. **LNL Group (Umbrella):** The professional umbrella brand.
2. **LNL Automations:** High-end AI workflows and tech stacks (n8n, Replicate, Make, Lovable, Abacus.ai).
3. **LNL Creatives:** Local Authority Content for Raleigh, Columbus, and Moscow.

## Core Value Proposition
- **The Map vs. The Guide:** Our services range from providing the "Map" (Custom Content Pack - Digital Localization) to being the "Guide" (Brand Growth Tier - Physical Presence & Management).
- **Geographic Focus:** Raleigh/Durham, Columbus, and Moscow markets.

## Tech Stack Requirements
- **Frontend:** Modern, responsive, dark-mode compatible.
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express.
- **Integrations:** Webhooks for n8n/Make, Google Tasks API for lead management.
- **Logic:** Must handle tiered pricing displays and geo-targeted metadata.

## Aesthetic Guidelines
- Professional, tech-forward, minimalist, and "High-End."
- Use local imagery/context to anchor the Brand Growth Tier.
